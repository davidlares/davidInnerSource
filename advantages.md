## InnerSource Strategy Specific Advantages

### Faster development

Programmers use unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration to remove bugs at early stages

### Complete documentation

Code is documented better, both in-code comments and less formally on discussion lists

### Code reuse

Programmers across the organization understand the code and architecture of modules developed by other teams

### Cross-team collaboration

Contributions by members outside of the team are frictionless and rarely have to be rewritten

### Development with GitHub

GitHub maintains private repositories for in-house projects as well as public repositories for open source code
